# Welcome to the nJexl wiki!

nJexl is continuation of Apache Jexl project ( http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl ).
All I wanted is a language where I can write my test automation freely - i.e. using theories from testing.
There was none available. Worse still - one can not write test automation freely using Java - and as almost all of modern enterprise apps are written using Java.

Thus, one needs a channel of working out a JVM scripting language that can freely call and act on POJOs.
Thus, the idea of extending jexl.

After cloning jexl - and modifying it heavily - it looked like a better option would be a public release.
And hence nJexl was born. The *n* stands for Neo.

It is an interpreted language. And it is fast, at least 2 times faster than python.
